The vision of the founders was a broad educational endeavor, ""to promote education in the scientific and mechanic arts and in other subjects relating to the conduct and development of business and industry."" When the Virginia Mechanics Institute was incorporated in 1856, work began with a school of design and a night school. It provided a chemical laboratory, a library, public lectures, and an annual exhibit of the best inventions or works of Virginia mechanics (female as well as male). Virginia Mechanics Institute was a non-profit, non-stock Virginia corporation. It was exclusively an evening school, giving opportunities for technical education to boys and men who held jobs during the day or who were trying to find employment. Applicants had to be at least fifteen years old and of good moral character. During the long period of its independent existence, the institute received the liberal financial support of the City government which made it possible to maintain a schedule of very modest student fees.","",NA," VA",-78.6568942,37.4315734
